        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Mustafa, a passionate third-year economics student at York University with a keen interest in blockchain technology. Although I'm relatively new to coding, I've gained significant experience in management and marketing within the crypto space, contributing to projects with a strong focus on Web 3 development.</p>
        
        <h3>Experience in Crypto/Blockchain</h3>
        <p>With over 2 years of experience in crypto and DeFi, I've honed my skills in project management, strategic marketing, and community building. I have contributed to various crypto projects, and I'm proud to have been part of the WebAi project, which is currently estimated at 4 million dollars.</p>
        
        <h3>Interest in Cryptocurrencies</h3>
        <p>My interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, has driven me to explore the technical and economic aspects of the blockchain industry.</p>
